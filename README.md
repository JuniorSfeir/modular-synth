# Modular Synthesizer

My fiancee and I plan to build a modular synthesizer, for fun. Here's a repository to hold all kinds of stuff to do with that. I imagine it'll hold the following

- Schematic designs
- PCB designs derived from those schematic design
- Some 3D modeling for related hardware
- Any microcontroller code
